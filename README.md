# DataCamp Project: Analysis of High-Growth Companies in Top-Performing Industries

## Description:

This GitHub repository contains a data analysis project focused on identifying high-growth companies in top-performing industries. The project leverages a comprehensive database of companies, funding, and industry information to provide valuable insights for an investment firm.

## Project Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to analyze trends in high-growth companies and determine the top-performing industries based on the number of new unicorns created in the years 2019, 2020, and 2021 combined. The analysis aims to help the investment firm gain a deeper understanding of industry trends and structure their portfolio for optimal growth.

## Project Steps:

1. **Finding the Top Industries**: Identify the top-performing industries by counting the number of new unicorns in 2019, 2020, and 2021 combined. Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) to store the top three industries and their corresponding number of unicorns.

2. **Gathering Yearly Rankings Data**: Build another CTE to gather data on the number of unicorns, industry, year, and average valuation for each industry between 2019 and 2021. This step aggregates relevant information about high-growth companies in the top-performing industries.

3. **Returning the Final Results**: Combine the results from the previous steps to create a final query that returns a table containing industry, year, number of unicorns, and average valuation (in billions of dollars, rounded to two decimal places). The results are sorted by year and the number of unicorns to provide valuable insights to the investment firm.

## Dataset:

The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset that includes details about company join dates, funding information, industries, company names, and headquarters' locations. The dataset enables a thorough analysis of high-growth companies across various industries.

## Execution and Results:

The project's SQL queries can be executed in any SQL environment or database interface. Upon execution, the results will provide valuable insights into the top-performing industries and their high-growth companies in the specified years. The investment firm can use this information to make data-driven decisions when structuring its investment portfolio.

## Conclusion:

This GitHub repository offers a complete data analysis project aimed at assisting an investment firm in identifying high-growth companies in top-performing industries. By leveraging the provided dataset and running the SQL queries, the investment firm gains valuable insights to make informed decisions and position its portfolio for success in the dynamic market landscape.
